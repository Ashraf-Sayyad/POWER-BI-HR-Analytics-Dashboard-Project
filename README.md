### **Key Observations:**
1. **Attrition Rate**:
   - The overall attrition rate is 16.1%, which is relatively high. Identifying the root causes in high-attrition groups can help formulate targeted retention strategies.

2. **Education-Based Insights**:
   - Attrition is highest among employees with Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (27%) education backgrounds. This could indicate dissatisfaction or lack of growth opportunities in roles that require these qualifications.

3. **Age-Based Trends**:
   - The 26–35 age group shows the highest attrition (116 employees). This age group might be seeking career growth, better compensation, or work-life balance.
   - Employees aged 46+ show lower attrition rates, suggesting they may feel more settled or satisfied.

4. **Salary Slab Analysis**:
   - A majority of attrition (163 out of 237) occurs among employees earning below $5K. Salary dissatisfaction or lack of financial incentives might be a significant reason.

5. **Years at Company**:
   - Employees leaving in their first year (59) make up the largest proportion. This indicates potential issues in onboarding, alignment of job roles with expectations, or early dissatisfaction.

6. **Job Role Breakdown**:
   - Laboratory Technicians (62) and Sales Executives (57) show the highest attrition among job roles. These roles might require closer evaluation of workload, growth opportunities, or job satisfaction.

7. **Gender Distribution**:
   - Attrition is higher among males (140 vs. 79 females). Analyzing male employee feedback might help identify specific challenges.
